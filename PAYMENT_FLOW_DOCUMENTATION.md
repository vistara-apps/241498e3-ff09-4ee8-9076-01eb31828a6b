# PlantPal AI x402 Payment Flow Implementation

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the x402 payment flow implementation for PlantPal AI, including USDC payments on the Base network, transaction confirmations, and error handling.

## ‚úÖ Implementation Status

- [x] **Wagmi useWalletClient Integration** - Complete
- [x] **x402-axios Payment Flow** - Complete  
- [x] **USDC on Base Integration** - Complete
- [x] **Transaction Confirmations** - Complete
- [x] **Error Handling** - Complete

## Architecture

### 1. Wagmi Configuration (`app/providers.tsx`)

```typescript
// Wagmi configuration for Base network
const config = createConfig({
  chains: [base],
  transports: {
    [base.id]: http(),
  },
});

// Wrapped with QueryClient for React Query support
<WagmiProvider config={config}>
  <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
    <OnchainKitProvider>
      {children}
    </OnchainKitProvider>
  </QueryClientProvider>
</WagmiProvider>
```

### 2. Payment Service (`lib/payment.ts`)

The `PaymentService` class handles all payment operations:

- **USDC Balance Checking**: Uses `publicClient.readContract` to check USDC balance
- **Payment Creation**: Uses `walletClient.writeContract` to execute USDC transfers
- **Transaction Confirmation**: Monitors transaction status via API endpoints
- **x402 Flow**: Integrates with `withPaymentInterceptor` for automatic payment handling

### 3. Payment Component (`app/components/PaymentFlow.tsx`)

React component that provides:

- Wallet connection status
- Balance checking and affordability validation
- Payment execution with real-time status updates
- Transaction confirmation with link to block explorer
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

## Key Features

### USDC on Base Network

- **Token Address**: `0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913` (Native USDC on Base)
- **Subscription Price**: $5.99 USDC per month
- **No bridging required**: Native USDC support eliminates complexity

### Transaction Confirmations

The system provides multiple layers of transaction confirmation:

1. **Immediate Response**: Transaction hash returned immediately after submission
2. **Wagmi Hook**: `useWaitForTransactionReceipt` for real-time status updates
3. **API Verification**: Custom endpoint `/api/payments/status/[hash]` for additional confirmation
4. **Block Explorer Integration**: Direct links to Basescan for transaction details

### Error Handling Scenarios

The implementation handles various error conditions:

- **Insufficient Balance**: Clear user messaging with balance requirements
- **Wallet Not Connected**: Prompts for wallet connection
- **Transaction Rejection**: User-friendly error messages
- **Network Issues**: Retry mechanisms and fallback options
- **Gas Estimation Failures**: Graceful degradation

## API Endpoints

### 1. Transaction Status Check

**GET** `/api/payments/status/[hash]`

```typescript
// Response format
{
  transactionHash: string,
  status: 'pending' | 'confirmed' | 'failed',
  blockNumber?: string,
  gasUsed?: string,
  timestamp: string
}
```

### 2. x402 Payment Handler

**POST** `/api/payments/x402`

Implements the x402 payment protocol:
- Returns 402 status when payment is required
- Provides payment requirements in response
- Validates subscription status

## x402 Payment Protocol Integration

The implementation uses the `x402-axios` library to handle HTTP 402 Payment Required responses:

```typescript
// Automatic payment handling
const x402Client = withPaymentInterceptor(baseClient, walletClient);

// Makes request, handles 402 automatically
const response = await x402Client.post('/premium-endpoint', data);
```

## Testing Scenarios

### 1. Successful Payment Flow ‚úÖ

1. User connects wallet
2. System checks USDC balance (sufficient)
3. User initiates payment
4. Transaction submitted to Base network
5. System monitors confirmation status
6. Success state displayed with transaction details

### 2. Insufficient Balance ‚ö†Ô∏è

1. User connects wallet
2. System checks USDC balance (insufficient)
3. Payment button disabled with clear messaging
4. User guided to add funds

### 3. Transaction Failure ‚ùå

1. Payment initiated successfully
2. Transaction reverted on-chain
3. Error state displayed
4. User can retry payment

### 4. x402 Flow üîÑ

1. API request to premium endpoint
2. 402 Payment Required response received
3. Payment automatically processed
4. Original request retried with payment proof
5. Access granted to premium features

## Security Considerations

- **Client-side Balance Checks**: For UX only; server validates actual transactions
- **Transaction Verification**: Multiple confirmation layers prevent false positives
- **Error Sanitization**: Sensitive error details logged server-side only
- **Payment Requirements**: All payment amounts verified on-chain

## User Experience Features

- **Real-time Balance Display**: Shows USDC balance and affordability
- **Progress Indicators**: Clear visual feedback during payment process
- **Transaction Links**: Direct links to block explorer for transparency
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback options for various failure scenarios
- **Mobile Responsive**: Optimized for all device sizes

## Integration with Coinbase OnchainKit

The payment flow integrates seamlessly with Coinbase OnchainKit:

- **Wallet Connection**: Uses OnchainKit's `ConnectWallet` component
- **Identity Display**: Shows user avatar and ENS names
- **Base Network**: Optimized for Base network transactions
- **Developer Experience**: Simplified wallet interactions

## Monitoring and Analytics

The implementation includes hooks for monitoring:

- **Transaction Success/Failure Rates**: Track payment completion
- **Error Categories**: Categorize and monitor common issues
- **User Journey Analytics**: Understand payment flow bottlenecks
- **Performance Metrics**: Transaction confirmation times

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the payment system:

1. **Subscription Management**: Automatic renewal and cancellation
2. **Payment Methods**: Support for additional tokens/payment methods
3. **Discount Codes**: Promotional pricing implementation
4. **Usage-based Billing**: Per-message or per-feature pricing
5. **Multi-chain Support**: Expand beyond Base network

## Conclusion

The x402 payment flow implementation for PlantPal AI provides a robust, user-friendly, and secure payment system that leverages:

- Modern Web3 infrastructure (Wagmi, Viem, Base)
- Industry standards (x402 payment protocol)
- Professional UX patterns (real-time feedback, error handling)
- Comprehensive testing and monitoring

The system is production-ready and follows best practices for Web3 payment applications.
